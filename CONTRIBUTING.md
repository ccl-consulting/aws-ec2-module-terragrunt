## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that promotes a welcoming and inclusive environment. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Terraform** >= 1.0
- **Terragrunt** >= 0.35
- **Git** for version control
- **AWS CLI** configured (for testing)
- **GitHub account** with appropriate permissions

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aws-ec2-module-terragrunt.git
   cd aws-ec2-module-terragrunt
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ccl-consulting/aws-ec2-module-terragrunt.git
   ```

3. **Install development tools**
   ```bash
   # Install terraform-docs for documentation generation
   curl -L https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/releases/download/v0.16.0/terraform-docs-v0.16.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o terraform-docs.tar.gz
   tar -xzf terraform-docs.tar.gz
   sudo mv terraform-docs /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Update documentation as needed
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure security best practices are followed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Format Terraform code
terraform fmt -recursive

# Validate Terraform code
terraform init -backend=false
terraform validate

# Format Terragrunt files
find . -name "*.hcl" -exec terragrunt hclfmt {} \;

# Run security scan (if checkov is installed)
checkov -d . --framework terraform
```

### 4. Update Documentation

```bash
# Generate updated documentation
terraform-docs markdown table --output-file README.md --output-mode inject .
```

### 5. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Branch Protection Rules

This repository has the following branch protection rules:

### Main Branch (`main`)

- âœ… **Require pull request reviews before merging**
  - Required approving reviews: 1
  - Require review from code owners
  - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed

- âœ… **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Required status checks:
    - `validate` (Terraform validation)
    - `security-scan` (Security scanning)
    - `documentation` (Documentation check)
    - `test` (Configuration testing)

- âœ… **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

- âœ… **Require signed commits**

- âœ… **Include administrators** (Admins must follow the same rules)

- âœ… **Restrict pushes that create files**

- âœ… **Allow force pushes** (Disabled)

- âœ… **Allow deletions** (Disabled)

### Admin Privileges

- **Repository Admins** can:
  - Merge pull requests without review (emergency situations only)
  - Modify repository settings
  - Manage branch protection rules
  - Create and manage releases

- **Non-Admin Contributors** must:
  - Submit pull requests for all changes
  - Have changes reviewed by repository admins
  - Pass all required status checks
  - Follow the contribution guidelines

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create Pull Request

- Use a descriptive title following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Fill out the pull request template completely
- Link any related issues

### 2. Pull Request Template

```markdown

- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Security improvement

## Testing
- [ ] I have tested these changes locally
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

```

### 3. Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All CI/CD pipeline checks must pass
2. **Code Review**: At least one admin must approve the changes
3. **Security Review**: Security-related changes require additional scrutiny
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure documentation is updated

### 4. Merge Process

- **Squash and merge** is preferred for feature branches
- **Create a merge commit** for release branches
- Delete feature branch after merge

## Coding Standards

### Terraform Code Style

```hcl
# Use descriptive resource names
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  
  # Group related configurations
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
  subnet_id              = var.subnet_id
  
  # Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
  tags = {
    Name        = var.instance_name
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

### Variable Naming

```hcl
# Use snake_case for variables
variable "instance_type" {
  type        = string
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  default     = "t3.micro"
  
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["t3.micro", "t3.small", "t3.medium"], var.instance_type)
    error_message = "Instance type must be t3.micro, t3.small, or t3.medium."
  }
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- All variables must have descriptions
- All outputs must have descriptions
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep README.md up to date

## Testing

### Required Tests

1. **Terraform Validation**
   ```bash
   terraform init -backend=false
   terraform validate
   ```

2. **Format Check**
   ```bash
   terraform fmt -check -recursive
   ```

3. **Security Scan**
   ```bash
   checkov -d . --framework terraform
   ```

4. **Configuration Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test each example configuration
   terragrunt validate --terragrunt-non-interactive
   ```

### Test Environment Guidelines

- Use AWS free tier resources for testing
- Clean up resources after testing
- Never commit real AWS credentials
- Use placeholder values in examples

## Security Guidelines

### Code Security

- âœ… No hardcoded credentials
- âœ… No sensitive information in code
- âœ… Use AWS IAM roles instead of access keys
- âœ… Enable encryption by default
- âœ… Follow least privilege principle
- âœ… Validate all inputs

### Network Security

- âœ… Restrict security group rules
- âœ… Use specific CIDR blocks
- âœ… Avoid `0.0.0.0/0` for ingress rules
- âœ… Implement egress restrictions when needed

### Infrastructure Security

- âœ… Enable EBS encryption
- âœ… Use KMS keys for encryption
- âœ… Enable CloudWatch monitoring
- âœ… Implement backup strategies
- âœ… Use latest AMIs with security patches

## Release Process

Releases are automated through GitHub Actions:

1. **Merge to Main**: When changes are merged to `main`
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: All tests must pass
3. **Automatic Release**: Version is incremented and release is created
4. **Changelog**: Generated from commit messages

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the README.md and examples
- **Issues**: Search existing issues or create a new one
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- **Contact**: Reach out to the CCL Consulting team

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- GitHub contributor graph
